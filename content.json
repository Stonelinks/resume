Wrote intuitive software to simplify fabrication of X-ray optics in multiple production scenarios. Designed sample manipulation hardware and a high strength production chamber mount using CAD. Saved time and lowered costs by developing a more efficient shutter controller now used on all production chambers in the lab. Worked closely with physicists, component vendors, machinists and other key stakeholders to complete project on time. Supervised a high school student to characterize potential optic substrates with a high precision 3D profilemeter."
