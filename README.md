Lucas Doyle's Resume
======

If you're looking for my resume itself check [here](https://github.com/Stonelinks/resume/blob/master/src/resume.md).

This was made to streamline how I manage my resume. Basically all the important information for my resume stored in content.json, and generator.py parses this and generates a text, markdown and html version of my resume. The Makefile handles generation of the PDF and deployment to my website.
