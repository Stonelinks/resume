            Designed and implemented the web interface to MUJIN's revolutionary industrial robotics motion planning platform from the ground up.
            
            - Wrote a large scale Backbone application that uses MUJIN's RESTful API to implement complicated robotics workflows in a user-friendly manner
            - Learned to think like a customer to make important UI / UX decisions in an environment where analytics are unavailable
            - Worked with a small, highly international team to coordinate API design and implement major features on an extremely tight schedule
            - Wrote tools (and leveraged existing ones) to enable rapid development / build / deployment cycles and manage things like internationalization
            - Implemented a full-featured scenegraph-based WebGL viewer that hooked into Backbone's model event API
